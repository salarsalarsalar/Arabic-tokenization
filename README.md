This is an initial phase. where rank numbers to tokens of the arabic language were given according to;
- Past, Present, Future form of the word
- Rafa(subject), Nasb(object), Jarr form of the word.
- Singular, dual, plural form of the word.
- Masculine, Feminine form of the word.
- ranking based on Morphological forms

What not has been done yet:
- Ranking based on whether the word form is a proper or improper noun
- Ranking based verb, noun, adjective, pronoun, etc form of the word.
- Ranking all of the diacritics, not just the end ones(Rafa, nasb, Jarr)
- Ranking based on Madd (ا ، و ، ي) on the words.
- Importing these rules into Urdu and Persian language as they use many of the Arabic contexts
- and Many other rules Which are not coming into my mind right now


- The main Idea here is to show that the superiority of Arabic language by showing how easy it is to tokenize Arabic words as compared to English words as 
you can make tokens of each words using the grammar rules and morphology formulas found in the Arabic language
- English could also be tokenized in a similar fashion by first tokenizing Latin or Greek but I do not have any knowledge of those languages.


NOTE: INVOVLEMENT OF AI WAS USED HERE TO GENERATE THIS CODE, I USED CLAUDE AI TO GENERATE ALL OF THIS REFERENCES OF THE PROMPTS BELOW:


- I want you to write a program in python which analyzes Arabic. The program has all morphological patterns of arabic words, has all forms (nasb, jarr, and rafa). it also has all irregular patterns as well
- Now i want you to give rank poits according to rafa, nasb, jarr of the word; future, present, or past form of the word; singular, dual, plural form of the word; and masculine, feminine form of the word. it analyses words, phrase and sentences according to these rules.

- So now i want to generate tokens based on these rules
- can you combine all of this together so that i dont have to

I couldnt find a way to share my claude chat here so the prompts would suffice
